# Flickr Image Search

# Features: 
  - Search images based on category
  - 3 column scrollable(endless) view with pagination
  - Followed MVVM architecture
  - Implemented image caching 
  - Supports iOS 10 and above
  
# Improvements needed:
  Due to the time limit and my hectic daily work, I am not able to cover the following things
  - Unit test cases
  - We can improve image refresh/load in a cell so that cell can't load multiple images when scrolling
  - We can de-couple the CollectionView from the FlickrImageViewController and make the view controller light weight
